After BSing our way past the front guard, waving the invitatyion we got from the devil dissenters, we find ourselves in Avernus, specifically into a carnival. from which excape is only possible by only by collecting 3 tokens, being given one to start.

First up, Harrow plays a game of target shooting, with targets being moved by invisible imps. He shoots the imps instead. After immobilizing them he uses his last few shots to hit all the targets. Earning all three tokens needed to leave the carnival.

Next, Nemry has to play a ring toss test with snakes as the rings. He speaks to the snake, "frees" it, and floats it over. Gaelia plays the same game and this time, he tosses the snake high iun the air, runs over beyong the pole, and lightning lures the snake onto the pole.

Nemry and Gaelia then play a classic "pea under the cup game". Nemry uses her ghost vision to follow it, I use a divination spell and the lord of Avernus answers. The revealed cup has three instead of two. The devil sees the coins checks his cup where he moved them with two, and then is sucked into the earth. I take my coins and Asami takes 2 the two the chain devil had moved. Thusly we completed our collection.

We are promptly escorted by some imps into a waiting room by an amnizu devil. One of the paintings psychically calls to us, Harrow and Nemry are taken in and touches the painting, which poisons them. At this point A butler devil says"time to move on" and the carnival disappears, leaving the mortals behind. They are still unable to leave the area of the carnival, and a giant red cloud comes over our location and then slams down over the area the carnival used to becrushing everyone except for us. We are now in the flying fortress of Zariel.
