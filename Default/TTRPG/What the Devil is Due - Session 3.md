At the end of the last session, One of the skyships of Zarael fell on top of the carnival. We are teleported onto the ship and invited to dinner by a portbellied amnizu. The flowers are guns. The food dopesn't look monstrous but is almost certainly glamoured. Zarael sits on a throne of black iron flanked by a Baelzthos general of logistics pit fiend. After casting a spell to ensure privacy, we begin to discuss getting us down.

Plan A, Have a tree transported down the layers and then use the spell _Transport via Tree_ to Teleport down. This is shot down as being unwise as we probably need a few more levels. We are contracted to get the Hand of Vecna from a Dragonborn, a shard from the mirror of Mephistar (the city of fear) to the "NorthEast", and the chains of Styx from the Bels Forge. The loophole is that we have to deliver her items to her and that will require us onto her own proper ship which will require us to pass through it and leave through the main hole down without arousing suspicion.

After Signing, we are given a Mad Max-styled Tank called the Soul Grinder and Descend onto the plains of Avernus(_Roll Credits_).

Our first encounter on the plains is a buzzing cloud that follows us going down the highway. In a burst of Fire and Buzzing, we are assaulted by a number of wasp-like demons. After utilizing some of the Soul Grinders weapons, we drive them off.

We come to a Bridge that crosses a river of green goo the pit of Shumrach. There are mechanical devices lowering and pulling up cages with green monsters in them into the pit. One of them, named Bazit, hails us and says he was imprisoned for stealing soul coins he'll give us a bunch if we free them. After much deliberating we smash the mechanism with the Soul Grinders wrecking ball and tow him out. He tells us that the man at the obelisk in the distance is not to be trusted and that those who seek the star will be burned with the frosted wings.

Ominous...
