Possible Spoilers for Dragon Heist, Tomb of Annihilation,

The Cast

-   Atlan Gran (Me) - A Human Wildfire Druid, recently reincarnated into a Tiefling. Pyromaniac and general troublemaker.
-   Harrow Tench - A Human investigative rogue who just wants to retire but keeps getting pulled back in.
-   Gaelia Ernst - A Wood Elf Land Druid
-   Nemry Oakwish- An Eladrin Fey Warlock whose mode and powers change like the seasons.
-   Asami Fulmina - An Air Genasi Storm Sorceror working with the Grey Hand of Waterdeep
-   The GM - Has made it clear that he's going to be throwing everything and the book at us and to expect a high body count.

Our characters leave the tomb of annihilation and use a tree walking spell to return to Waterdeep. Instead of emerging into the emerald enclave we emerge into fire and screaming. With invitations to the end of the multiverse.

We quickly rush back to our home base in Trollskull alley at the bar _The Invisible Barkeep_ arriving to the sounds of combat. A block away is what appears to be the recently erected headquarters of the military and our bar has been turned into an emergency infirmary.

After checking on the status of our bar we head to the tower to meet up with a number of high-level notables we've met over the course of our adventures. They've been trying to close hell portals all over the city and failing while most of our characters were off in Chult dealing with the events of Tomb of Annihilation. The plan to deal with this? While they hold things together on this side, we are to go into hell and close the portals. What can go wrong?

We are given a number of magic items to assist in our journey. Including Blackstaffs wizard staff, A Circlet of the Dragon which enhances wild shape, A crossbow called The Last Word with different chambers with a different ability for each, and a tome for the warlock called the Tome of Tablain which gives a bunch of extra pact boons. Importantly for making my character even viable in a campaign where everyone is immune to fire, I'm given a special Sunblade that lets me turn my fire damage to radiant so long as I'm being lawful good. This shall be this character's greatest challenge to not be chaotic. Our GM is most generous. I can't wait to see how he messes with us. For the record, we are starting this campaign with level 14 characters. We are firmly into the "Everything is Broken and unbalanced" area of 5e.

After receiving these items we are visited by some envoys from hell who would like the multiverse to not end. Apparently, all devilish contracts have the finest print requiring the devils to help end the multiverse and by so doing end themselves. So we've been invited on a "Tour" of the 9 hells which will give us a degree of diplomatic immunity.

After a long rest, we head towards the largest portal we can see, the manor of the Casallanters - Demon worshipers who got away from us at the end of the Dragon Heist after they murdered a bunch of people. On our way there we are ambushed by a group of pit fiends and Balors, really scary demons. We have several deaths (undone thanks to revives. We have more money than god at this point) and while we kill several of them, two pit fiends escape. Ending our session with a cutscene of one of our former enemies contacting us from the underworld. All in all a bombastic start to the campaign.
